Excited to be attending the [64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control](https://cdc2025.ieeecss.org) in beautiful Rio de Janeiro 🌞 
On Wednesday, I present(ed) my work on stabilization of population dynamics in the Session “Estimation and Control of Distributed Parameter Systems III”. Find an extended preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23013).
