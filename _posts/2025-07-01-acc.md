I will be presenting research from my postdoc at University of Stuttgart & UC San Diego at the [American Control Conference (ACC)](https://acc2025.a2c2.org) in Denver, CO. Drop by session TuB18 Estimation and Control of Distributed Parameter Systems I on Tuesday after lunch to meet me and my co-authors Miroslav Krstic, Mamadou Diagne, Iasson Karafyllis, Cenk Demir, and Oliver Sawodny. 

I will also attend the workshop [Physics-Informed Machine Learning in Control](https://sites.google.com/view/acc-physics-informed-learning) on Monday, and am really looking forward to connecting with people working on learning-based control. See you soon!
