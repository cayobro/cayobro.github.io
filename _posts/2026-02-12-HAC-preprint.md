title: "[new preprint] Bladder vessel segmentation using a hybrid attention-convolution framework"
date: 2025-12-09
---

Endoscopic navigation inside the hollow and deformable urinary bladder is extremely difficult. Tracking suspicious areas with tumors across multiple interventions? Almost impossible due to the lack of stable landmarks.

Our new research shows us how to use the visible blood vessels to create a patient-specific vascular fingerprint that we can use for navigation, basically like a roadmap helping surgeons find their way back to important spots.
