Super excited to share that I have been awarded the [Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/feodor-lynen-research-fellowship) by the [Alexander von Humboldt Foundation](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/)! The Foundation’s motto “We support people, not projects” makes this recognition feel especially meaningful. #humboldtian

Starting in 2026, the 2-year funding will give me the opportunity to carry out my independent research in the field of learning-enhanced control for soft, bioinspired robots, hosted by Prof. [Ellen Kuhl](https://livingmatter.stanford.edu) at Stanford University.

At the moment, I’m already diving deep into elephant-trunk-inspired soft robotic arms (stay tuned for papers!), and I look forward to starting a collaboration with [Cosimo Della Santina](https://cosimodellasantina.eu) at Delft University of Technology this fall, focusing on physical control of soft robots.
