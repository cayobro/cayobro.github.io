Exciting two weeks at TU Delft 🇳🇱

I had the opportunity to visit [Cosimo della Santina](https://cosimodellasantina.eu), an Associate Professor in the [Cognitive Robotics](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/me/about/departments/cognitive-robotics-cor/) department of TU Delft. Being a leader in the field of *soft robot control*, he and his team gave me great insights on how to bring my research on [elephant-trunk inspired robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03547) to the next level! Excited to continue working together on the ideas we developed.
