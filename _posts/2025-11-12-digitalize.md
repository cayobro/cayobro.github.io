Exciting days in Stockholm 🇸🇪 

I was chosen as a *Future Digileader* by [Digital Futures](https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/event/future-digileaders-25/) | [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en)! Thank you for inviting me to Sweden to take part in [Digitalize In Stockholm](https://digitalizeinsthlm.se), think about digitalisation, and dive into the Scandinavian research landscape. 
While I was in Stockholm, I also had the opportunity to visit the [Intelligent Heart Technology Lab](https://www.kth.se/profile/seraina) and learn about soft robotic devices for cardiovascular applications 🫀
