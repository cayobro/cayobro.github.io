I attended the [47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering Medicine and Biology Society](https://embc.embs.org/2025/) in Copenhagen, Denmark, from July 14th to July 17.
Our three papers are
* “BlaVeS: A Novel Hand-Labeled Dataset for Improved Bladder Vessel Segmentation with Modified U-Net” by Franziska Krauß. This work tackles the challenges of variable lighting and tissue deformation in endoscopy by proposing a robust U-Net-based model with attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance for bladder vessel segmentation. Make sure to check out our corresponding dataset [here](https://darus.uni-stuttgart.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18419/DARUS-4763) — the first publicly available dataset for blood vessel segmentation in urinary bladder endoscopy images!
* “Multiphysical Tumor Tissue Modeling for Improved Multimodal Sensor-Based Diagnostics” by Matthias Ege. We introduce a comprehensive tissue model that simulates the electro-mechanical behavior of bladder tumors to generate synthetic, multimodal datasets—laying the foundation for better sensor fusion and real-time tissue classification during surgery.
* “Tumor Margin Estimation through Simulated Impedivity Mappings Using a Multielectrode Sensor Array” by Zoltan Lovasz. Impedance sensor arrays can help to detect tumorous cell aggregations. This study presents a novel impedivity mapping approach that significantly improves tumor margin estimation accuracy over traditional impedance maps, particularly for complex tumor scenarios.

Furthermore, I co-chaired a few sessions, and we organized a German EMBS Chapter Meetup.
