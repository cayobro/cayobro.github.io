Full circle moment: I just became an Associate Editor for [Mechatronics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/mechatronics) (Elsevier), a journal by the [International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)](https://www.ifac-control.org) focusing on mechatronics and robotics.

This is extra special for me because it’s the journal where I published my very first paper "Nonlinear disturbance observers for robotic continuum manipulators" back in 2020, which also became my most-cited paper up to this day. (Moral of the story: start strong… and then spend the rest of your career wondering if you’ll ever top that first paper 🥲)

👉 Here’s the [“legendary first paper”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957415821000246)

Excited to contribute from the other side of the review process!
