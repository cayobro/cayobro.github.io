# About

<!--author-->

My current projects include:
* bioinspired (soft) robots: How to combine biomechanics, traditional model-based approaches, and AI to make these robots move the way we want to?
* PDE control in the context of population dynamics: How can we mathematically describe and stabilize systems of multiple populations that occur, for example, in epidemics, demography, and ecology?
* sensors and AI for tumor detection: How can we measure altered physical tissue properties in tumor, combine this information with imaging data and use AI to help surgeons to make decisions?
