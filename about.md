# About

<!--author-->

My current [projects](/projects/) include:
* [bioinspired (soft) robots](/projects/trunk-project/): How to combine biomechanics, traditional model-based approaches, and AI to make these robots move the way we want to?
* PDE control in the context of [population dynamics](/projects/popdyn/): How can we mathematically describe and stabilize systems of multiple populations that occur, for example, in epidemics, demography, and ecology?
* sensors and AI for [tumor detection](/projects/grk/): How can we measure altered physical tissue properties in tumor, combine this information with imaging data and use AI to help surgeons to make decisions?
